## Maps and Cars

This project demonstrates my ability to utilize React.js and the Google Maps API to provide a functional interface that allows users to manipulate the markers that are meant to serve as vehicles in the area.

## Motivation

This project was built as a take-home coding challenge for a Software Developer role, as well as a demonstration of my ability to problem-solve and develop clean and readable code.
